The making of this webpage has enabled me to learn a variety of new basic skills to start my journey in completing bootcamp. Touching on topics such as: HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. Although no problems arose from this experience as the languages I managed to learn quickly, however progress to remember the processes for the git/github, is something that I need to practice.
